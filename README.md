# HTTP/2 Client

Learning the HTTP v2 protocol from [RFC 7540](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html).
A copy of the protocol is at [rfc7540.txt](./rfc7540.txt), albeit in a less readable format.

Other than the RFC, I'm using these open source implementations of the protocol:

- [hyper h2](https://github.com/python-hyper/h2/tree/master)
- [Go net http2](https://github.com/golang/net/tree/master/http2)
- [fasthttp http2](https://github.com/fasthttp/http2)

Commonly read documentation pages:

- [Python struct](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)
- [Python sockets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
- [Python SSL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html)
